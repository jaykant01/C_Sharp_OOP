## 📘 Description

This repository is created to **practice and understand Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C#**.  
It is designed to build **strong OOP fundamentals** through **branch-wise learning**, where each branch focuses on a specific concept of C# OOP.

The repository is **gradually expanded** to include more OOP concepts with **clear explanations, diagrams, and practice programs**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Language:** C#  
- **Framework:** .NET  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub  

---

## 🌿 Repository Branches (OOP Concepts)

The repository follows a **step-by-step learning sequence**, starting from basics and moving toward advanced OOP concepts.

---

### 🔹 `class-and-object` Branch

Focuses on the **foundation of OOP** — Classes and Objects.

**Topics Covered:**
- Understanding classes and objects  
- Class structure in C#  
- Creating and using objects  
- Accessing class variables and methods  
- Multiple objects of a single class  
- Real-world OOP examples  

**Purpose:**  
To create a **strong base** for all other OOP concepts.

---

### 🔹 `constructors` Branch

Focuses on **object initialization using constructors**.

**Topics Covered:**
- What is a constructor  
- Default constructor  
- Parameterized constructor  
- Constructor overloading  
- `this` keyword with constructors  
- Real-world initialization examples  

**Purpose:**  
To understand how **objects are created and initialized** in memory.

---

### 🔹 `access-modifiers` Branch

Explains **data hiding and access control**.

**Topics Covered:**
- `public`  
- `private`  
- `protected`  
- `internal`  
- `protected internal`  
- `private protected`  
- Real-world access control examples  

**Purpose:**  
To ensure **security and controlled access** to class members.

---

### 🔹 `keywords` Branch

Covers **important C# keywords related to OOP**.

**Topics Covered:**
- `this`  
- `base`  
- `static`  
- `readonly`  
- `const`  
- `virtual` and `override`  
- `sealed`  
- `abstract`  

**Purpose:**  
To understand how **C# keywords enhance OOP behavior**.

---

### 🔹 `diagrams` Branch

Contains **UML diagrams** for better conceptual clarity.

**Diagrams Included:**
- Class Diagram  
- Object Diagram  
- Sequence Diagram  

**Purpose:**  
To visually understand **class structure, object relationships, and execution flow**  
(very useful for **system design and interviews**).

---

### 🔹 `object-modeling` Branch

Focuses on **designing OOP solutions from real-world problems**.

**Topics Covered:**
- Identifying classes from problem statements  
- Attributes and behaviors  
- Object relationships  
- Simple system modeling  
- Converting requirements into code  

**Purpose:**  
To develop **problem-solving and design thinking** using OOP.

---

### 🔹 `inheritance` Branch

Explains **code reusability using inheritance**.

**Topics Covered:**
- Base class and derived class  
- `protected` members  
- Method inheritance  
- Method overriding  
- `base` keyword usage  
- Real-world inheritance examples  

**Purpose:**  
To understand **IS-A relationships** and reuse existing functionality.

---

### 🔹 `oop-pillars` Branch

Covers the **four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming**.

**Topics Covered:**
- Encapsulation  
- Abstraction  
- Inheritance  
- Polymorphism  
- Real-world and code-based examples  

**Purpose:**  
To master **core OOP principles** used in real-world C# applications.

---

## ✨ Features
